        <h3>Computers</h3>
        <p>Stareing at s very young age I have always been around and loved computers. From the time that my father got
          our first family computer up until today my love for computers remains unchanged. This is the main reason that
          I got into Web Design / Development so that I could work with computers everyday and work with something that
          truly like to do.</p>

        <h3>Art and Design</h3>
        <p>While maintaing my passion for computers there was something else that I was also very devoted to, and that
          is art and design. As long as I can remember I have always been creating works of art that are aesthetically
          pleasing to the eye.</p>

        <p>In 5 years, I would like to be working for a medium sized business creating and managing websites and web
          developers to bring people amazing websites and create great client relationships. With the love for both

          something for a living that I love to do. Thank you for taking the time to read about me!</p>
